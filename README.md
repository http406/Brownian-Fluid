# Brownian-Fluid
Brownian motion is a random process where particles, such as molecules or colloidal particles, move randomly in a fluid medium due to collisions with solvent molecules. It's named after the botanist Robert Brown, who observed the erratic movement of pollen grains in water under a microscope.
